		<h2>Humans need not apply</h2>
		<h3>by Paul Leszko</h3>

		<img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/gcrc/dms/image/C5112AQHmmPbkSNgXtQ/article-cover_image-shrink_423_752/0?e=1542844800&v=beta&t=4pm5UkgurtgVJYMxQpkncTb51o_MxD7tnuQImrayTrs"> 

		<p>The video "Humans Need Not Apply" is a very honest look into the future of jobs are careers. CGP Grey made it clear that the "Robot Revolution" is something that is inevitable and something that humans must accept. The video points out how much cheaper it is to use robots for work instead of human labor, and how almost all jobs that can be replaced by robots (cashiers, transportation workers, waiters etc,) will be replaced in my life time. The video clearly shows us that the new generation of workers will not find the same jobs their parents had 30 or 40 years ago.  </p>

		<h2>Blown to Bits</h2>
		<h3> by Paul Leszko</h3>

		<p>The Blown to bits section I was called "All in your pocket." It was about how the British Government lost millions of people's information while it was being shipped through the postal service. They wanted to ship 2 computer drives that were not encrypted or even protected at all. The author points out how we're sending information all around the world, and that we should still protect what we send because it can get lost, or stolen. </p>

		<h2>Interview with dad</h2>
		<h3>by Paul Leszko</h3>
		<img src="http://www.eightieskids.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/High-Tech-80s-1.jpg">

		<p>Paul: How old were you when you got your first computer?</p>
		<p>Dariusz: It was around the late 80's. I started working with my dad in the department of education and worked with computers there.</p>
		<p>Paul: What was your favorite piece of technology when you were growing up?</p>
		<p>Dariusz: There have been tons of new things, but my favorite has got to be smart phones. They came pretty late but everything before the smart phone pales in comparison.</p>
		<p>Paul: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
		<p> Dariusz: Most of the tech that I grew up with either isn't here anymore or it's just been made smaller and faster. Cellphones are like multi-tools now, and computers have become way more accessible and easy to understand. </p>
		<p>Paul: Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>
		<p> Dariusz: I think that technology has overall been helpful for society. Things have sped up and become easier to understand. Of course there will be new challenges, and we need to be prepared to face them.
